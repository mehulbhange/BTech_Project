            <h5>What is noun?</h5>
            <p>A noun is a part of speech that names a person, place, thing, idea, action or quality. All nouns can be classified into two groups of nouns: common or proper.</p>
            <h6>Types of Noun:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Proper Noun</li>
                <li>Common Noun</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Proper nouns refer to the individual name of a person, place or thing. Examples might include Barcelona, Leonardo da Vinci, or Toyota Corolla.</p>
            <p>Common nouns are more generalized by comparison, and they can be further divided into abstract, collective, compound, countable concrete, uncountable concrete and verbal.</p>
            
            <h6>Examples of Noun used in Sentences</h6>
