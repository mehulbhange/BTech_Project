            <h4>Kid should watch this lesson carefully and parents should teach below points to their child</h4>
            <h5>Couting Backword activities for kids:</h5>
           <p>Practice a space ship countdown in suitably important voice! </p>
           <p>Play hide and seek and count backwards from 10 before calling out "Ready or not, here I come!"</p>
           <p>Flash card practice. Print out some of our Number Cards - our Digit Cards would work well for this. Hold up the numbers and get your child to count backwards as you do so.        </p>
           <p>Hands on practice. Print out a set of our Number Cards and ask your child to put them in the correct order then count down - from 10, or from any other number that you point to.</p>
           <p>Physical fun. Do you have 10 children? Give each of them a large number to hold (use some of our Number Cards or cut out large numbers using our Number Templates) and then ask them to line up from 1 to 10, and then from 10 to 1! Each time you get them to call out their number and bob up and down as they do so, with the rest of the class joining in with the counting.</p>
           <p>Hopscotch counting. Draw the numbers 0 to 10 with chalk and get the kids to jump or hop along them and then hop back, counting as they go.</p>
            <p>Use Number Lines. Print any of our Number Lines from 0 to 10 or 1 to 10 and display or use in front of you. Practise "hopping" down the line as you count. We've included appropriate Number Lines in the Resources section below.</p>

                    hello kids this is Kiki on the guava
                    tree say hello Kiki he is collecting
                    guavas in his basket for his baby monkey
                    so far he has collected three guavas and
                    he wants to collect two more but Kiki
                    wants to know how many gamez he will
                    have in total
                    let us help Kiki find out the total
                    number of goers with the help of forward
                    counting now you must be wondering what
                    forward counting is the order in which
                    we count numbers starting from 1 2 3 4 5
                    6 and so on is called forward counting
                    notice that you are actually adding 1 to
                    the previous number as we move one step
                    forward using this concept
                    let us now help Kiki you already know he
                    had 3 goers and he wants to add 2 more
                    notice he makes the first move to
                    collect the fourth gava and then he
                    makes the second move to collect the
                    fifth guava look he moved to times and
                    notice 3 plus 2 gives us 5
                    seeing a lot more goers on the tree Kiki
                    wants more and he starts picking more
                    gauze look he picked five more goers to
                    get a total of ten covers Wow
                    Kiki suddenly remembers that his best
                    buddy likes eating go verse two so he
                    again moves forward to collect more
                    gamez for Kiki he could just move three
                    more times as there is no space in the
                    basket Kiki is finally home
                    he wishes to give four covers to his
                    baby but he wonders how many goers he
                    would be left with after that
                    let us now help him find out the number
                    of Goya's he would be left with using
                    backward counting note that in backward
                    counting you count numbers in the
                    reverse order that means you are
                    actually subtracting one from the number
                    to move backward using this concept we
                    are going to help Kiki remember that
                    Kiki had collected thirteen gorras in
                    total so in order to give away for he
                    must start backward counting from number
                    13 look how he does by reverse counting
                    from 13 12 11 10 9 notice he did four
                    counts backwards so 13 minus four is
                    nine Kiki must also leave aside three
                    gobber's for his best buddy he is now
                    finally left with only six covers
                    well kids we hope you had fun learning
                    forward and backward counting by
