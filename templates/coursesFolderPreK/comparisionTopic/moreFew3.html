            <h3>Parent should follow below points while teaching more or less:</h3>
            <h4>Parent should teach kids simply giving following examples:</h4>
            <h5>Giant Dice</h5>
            <p>This is a game played with a small group of children. The group is divided into two teams. Each team has
                a giant game die. One child on each team tosses their dice and says the amount. The group decides which
                die has the most dots.</p>
            <h5>Game Cards</h5>
            <p>Regular playing cards can be used for this game or they can be made with stickers or stamps. Children
                play this game with one partner. Each child should have a set of cards that represent numbers 1-10, and
                each child’s cards should be different in some way (e.g. a different color or different picture). To
                play the game, each child takes the first card from their stack and places it on the table. The children
                determine which card has the most or same amount. The child whose card has the most wins that round and
                gets to keep both cards. If the cards are the same, they tie and each child keeps their own card. I have
                the children place the cards they win in a plastic basket so they won’t get mixed up with their other
                cards. At the end, the children can count to see how many cards they won, but my students seem to enjoy
                the game more if we don’t determine who won or lost at the end.</p>
            <h5>Block Building Game</h5>
            <p>Children roll a game die, determine the amount, and count out that many wooden cubes to stack into a
                tower. The die is rolled again to make a second tower. The children compare the towers to see which has
                the most, least, or same amount.</p>
            <h5>Bean Toss</h5>
            <p>Spray paint lima beans with two colors so that they have one color on each side. Place ten beans in a
                cup. Children dump the beans onto a mat (I used a sheet of craft foam for the mat). They count each
                color to see how many beans landed on the red side and how many landed on the blue side. They compare to
                see which colors have the most, least, or same amount.</p>
